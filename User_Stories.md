# User Stories

Each User Story should have 3 elements:
1. Name of the person's role
2. Name of the goal
3. Name of the benefit for each

Examples:

"As a social media user, I want to filter and sort the best tweets from my followees, so that I can stay up-to-date on trends."
"As a message board moderator, I want to create a new game by entering a description, so that I can invite other players to connect."

# Packing Pal User Stories

1. As a camper, I want to create lists of things to bring on my trip, so that I bring everything I need for a successful trip.
2. As a camper, I want to list activites on my trip, so that I can get suggested items for the activites.
3. As a campter, I want to be able to share my list, so that my friends know what to bring.
